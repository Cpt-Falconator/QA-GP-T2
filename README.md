## Brief
The initial brief required us (within a team) to create a Help Queue web application for use in the Academy, which functions as a CRUD list, allowing users to create issues and for trainers to mark them as complete.

### Team

- Fully functioning Help Queue application deployed via Kubernetes (EKS).
- Fully automated CI pipeline via Jenkins.
- User friendly GUI (React) & functional backend (Java/Spring).
- Application infrastructure built through Terraform and the adequate configuration management performed through Ansible.
